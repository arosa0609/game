    <h4> My project is supposed to represent a day to day life on pills and time in the day. If you don’t take enough pills with a given amount of time, you lose the game. Blue squares are time and worth 1/2 point, red squares are pills and worth 1 point. I myself take pills daily for psychosis and if I don’t take said pills before 12pm my mind can't function accordingly. This is what the game is supposed to represent. </h4>
